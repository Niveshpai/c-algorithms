## Overview

The repository is a collection of open-source implementation of a variety of algorithms implemented in C. The algorithms span topic from computer science. The implementations and the associated documentation are meant to provide a learning resource for educators and students. Hence, one may find more than one implementation for the same objective but using a different algorithm strategies and optimizations.

## Features

* The repository provides implementations of various algorithms in one of the most fundamental general purpose languages - [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)).
* Well documented source code with detailed explanations provide a valuable resource for educators and students alike.
* Each source code is atomic using standard C library [`libc`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library) and _no external libraries_ are required for their compilation and execution. Thus the fundamentals of the algorithms can be studied in much depth.
